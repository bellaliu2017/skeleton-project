It SHOULD NOT just be a repetition of the README, but COULD expand on some of the topics mentioned there. The primary focus SHOULD be on someone wanting to make use of the software/library rather than someone wanting to develop on it. The index page SHOULD be a brief introduction. All other sections SHOULD be separate pages, linked together via the MkDocs configuration. Some things to consider: Introduction What it is Why it exists How to obtain it Requirements Installation steps Quick Start. ie. what's the quickest way for someone to get up and running, covering the most common use cases.

Replacement \u00b6 Replace __author-name__ __author-username__ __author@email.com , skeleton-project , __package-name__ , __package-description__ , __year__ with their correct values in README.md , CHANGELOG.md , CONTRIBUTING.md , LICENSE , composer.json , Dockerfile and travis.yml files, then delete all the *.md files in the docs directory. Continuous Integration \u00b6 Our Open source projects rely on a set of external services to operate. Travis is our main continuous integration pipeline and performs testing and building. Scrutinizer profiles the code looking for coding standards violations and other recommendations. Packagist stores the build library for use by other projects with composer .

Docker Repositories \u00b6 This can be deployed in a few ways, either automatically using an Automated Build on Docker Hub , or by using a Manual Build process to a Standard Repository. Automated Build \u00b6 Automated build repositories are useful when the build process is simple and everything can happen inside the Dockerfile . The automated build, will automatically tag images for github branches with :branch-name and github tags with :tag . Commits pushed to master (or another chosen branch) to also become :latest . Create an Automated build: Add Automated Build Select the repository from github Change the namespace to graze Click Create Build Settings: Go to Build Settings Ensure that it is built on tag and branch and branch = master gets built as latest Create a build hook: This will build the image with extra arguments passed into the Dockerfile Create the file hooks/build Put the following in: #!/bin/sh docker build --build-arg BUILD_DATE = \" $( date -u + \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\" ) \" \\ --build-arg VCS_REF = \" $( git rev-parse --short HEAD ) \" \\ -t \" $IMAGE_NAME \" . Manual Build \u00b6 A manual build requires you to create a Standard Repository on Docker Hub . You SHOULD include a specific tagged version when pushing, and manually specify the latest tag yourself only when appropriate. Create a standard repository: Add Repository Push images to it using the docker command line: docker login docker build --build-arg BUILD_DATE = \" $( date -u + \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\" ) \" \\ --build-arg VCS_REF = \" $( git rev-parse --short HEAD ) \" \\ -t graze/skeleton:<tag> . docker push graze/skeleton:<tag> Setting up Permissions \u00b6 By default only the creator of a repository has access to it, so more permissions for your team are required.
