**Note:** Replace `:author-name` `:author-username` `:author-email` `:package-name` `:package-description` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go, try and limit it to a paragraph or two. It should outline the 'mission' or goals of the project
to make it clear what the project is trying to achieve and the problems that it solves.
