# __package-name__

This is where your project documentation should go. It SHOULD NOT just be a
repetition of the README, but COULD expand on some of the topics mentioned
there. The primary focus SHOULD be on someone wanting to make use of the
software/library rather than someone wanting to develop on it.

The index page SHOULD be a brief introduction. All other sections SHOULD be
separate pages, linked together via the mkdocs configuration.

Some things to consider:

- Introduction
  - What it is
  - Why it exists
  - How to obtain it
  - Requirements
  - Installation steps
- Quickstart.
  - ie. what's the quickest way for someone to get up and running,
    covering the most common use cases.
- Architecture
- Configuration
- Different use cases
- Deeper dive into individual features/components
- Limitations
- Any relevant history
- How to get help
- FAQ
