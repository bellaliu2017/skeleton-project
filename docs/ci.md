# Continuous Integration

Our Open source projects rely on a set of external services to operate.

1. [Travis](external_services/travis.md) Is our main continuous intergration pipeline and performs testing and building.
1. [Scrutinizer](external_services/scrutinizer.md) Profiles the code looking for coding standards and other recommendations.
1. [Packagist](external_services/packagist.md) Stores the build library for use by other projects with `composer`.
1. [Docker Hub](external_services/docker_hub.md) Is used to store `docker` images.
1. [Github](external_services/github.md) Is where the code is hosted.
1. [Github Pages](external_services/github_pages.md) Hosts any documentation using github pages.
